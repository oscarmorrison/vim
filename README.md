# VIMRC and plugins
this is a collection of my vimrc settings and plugins.

I use [Vim-Plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for managing plugins. Its got excellent support, easy setup,
parallel installation, conditional plugins.

I then use a combination a iterm base16shell, and base16shell6vim themes.
[base16-shell](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-shell)

###Installation
- clone repo into .vim  
        `git clone https://github.com/oscarmorrison/vimrc.git .vimrc`
- Symlink .vimrc   
        `ln -s ./vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc`
